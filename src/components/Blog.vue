          First, let's start with Vue.js. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. I was initially drawn to Vue.js because of its simplicity and ease of use.
          <br/>
          After spending some time learning the basics, I was impressed with its reactivity system and the ability to create reusable components. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Next, I learned about Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of 
          pre-defined CSS classes that you can use to style your HTML elements.
